= AeroGear DataSync Starter

AeroGear DataSync GraphQL based server and React Client

== DataSync Starter

Starter includes:

- Integration with Graphback (http://graphback.dev) that helps you to generate your backend and client side queries based on user provided business model
- Example React application that uses Offix client (http://offix.dev) to give you fully featured offline experience.
- Integration with Keycloak (SSO) for server and client Authentication and User management.
- GraphQL Subscriptions backed by an MQTT broker (AMQ)

=== GraphQL Client

The mobile application uses https://github.com/aerogear/offix[Offix Client] to provide additional offline capabilities on top of Apollo GraphQL.

=== GraphQL Server

The GraphQL server uses https://github.com/aerogear/graphback[Graphback] to provide GraphQL capabilities.

== Getting Started

Requirements:

- Docker and docker-compose
- Node.js 12.x or above
- (optional) access to a running OpenShift instance

=== Running app and server

Install dependencies 

. Build client

+
```shell
yarn
```
+

. Build client
+
```shell
yarn
yarn prepare:client
```
+

. Start the server
+
```shell
cd ./server
docker-compose up -d
yarn start
```


=== Running the Server with the Keycloak integration

Follow these instructions to set up Keycloak for Authentication/Authorization.


. Start Keycloak Server
+
```shell
cd server
npm run keycloak
```

. Configure the Keycloak Server
+
```shell
cd server
npm run keycloak:init
```

This command creates the necessary resources in Keycloak and prints instructions *you must follow to enable the integration.* 

Follow the instructions and copy the JSON configurations to the appropriate locations.
The DataSync Starter app and server will read these configurations and the integration will be enabled when they are started.

By default, two users that can log into the application are created.

- username: `developer`, password: `developer`
- username: `admin`, password: `admin`

==== Using the GraphQL playground with Keycloak

The GraphQL playground is available after a Keycloak login screen. Initially the following error will be displayed.

```
{
  "error": "Failed to fetch schema. Please check your connection"
}
```

The playground must be configured to send the Keycloak `Authorization` header with requests to the GraphQL server.

In the bottom left corner of the playground there is a field called **HTTP Headers** which will be added to requests sent by the playground.

Use `scripts/getToken.js` to get a valid header for the `developer` user.

The following script can be used to get a token for the default Keycloak credentials

```
cd server/scripts/keycloak
node getToken.js
```

Alternatively, the user-defined username and password can be passed into the script as arguments, as below

```
node getToken.js <username> <password>
```

The output will be in the form of a JSON object

```
{"Authorization":"Bearer <token string>"}
```

Copy the entire JSON object, then paste it into the HTTP Headers field in the playground. 
The error message should disappear and it is now possible to use the playground.

NOTE: The GraphQL server is using a `public` Keycloak client to redirect browsers to the login page. This is useful for testing the server locally but **it is not recommended for production**. For production GraphQL server applications you should use a `bearer` client.

[NOTE]
====
If Keycloak integration is enabled on the server, and the Keycloak server is running using a self-signed certificate, please make sure set this environment variable before running the server:

```shell
export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
```
====


=== Running the Client

. Install Ionic
+
```shell
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

. Change directory

+
```shell
cd client
```
+

. Install dependencies
+
```shell
npm install
```
+
. Start the app
+
```shell
npm run start
```
+


=== Adding keycloak integration to the client

Rename `keycloak.example.json` file in the `public` directory to `keycloak.json`. Replace the contents of the file
with the keycloak json object generated during the keycloak integration init script.
 
[source,js]
----
{
  "realm": "<your realm>",
  "auth-server-url": "https://your-server/auth",
  "ssl-required": "none",
  "resource": "<your-client>",
  "public-client": true,
  "use-resource-role-mappings": true,
  "confidential-port": 0
}
----

> NOTE: When running in cloud, developers can swap this file dynamically using config-map or openshift secret

=== Running Native projects

==== IOS
-----
cd client
yarn cap add ios
yarn run:ios
-----

==== Android:
-----
cd client
yarn cap add android
yarn run:android
-----

When running locally you will need to also enable http traffic. 
For example for android add `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` to AndroidManifest.xml

Project should stard in IDE and can be launched as any other native application

== Using MQTT for GraphQL subscriptions

1. Go to scripts ./mqtt
2. Execute docker-compose up
3. Set MQTT_HOST environment variable in .env file

MQTT_HOST=127.0.0.1

=== Running On OpenShift

Please check link:./openshift[.openshift] folder for more information.
